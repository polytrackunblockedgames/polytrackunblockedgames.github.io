- `G-PLACEHOLDER` → Your Google Analytics ID (e.g., `G-XYZ123456`)

### 2. Change Site Name (Optional)

If you want a different name than "PolyTrack":

Find and replace in both files:
- Find: `PolyTrack`
- Replace: `Your Site Name`

## 🎨 Color Scheme

Already set to PolyTrack colors:
- **Primary:** #c5d9f7 (Light blue from logo)
